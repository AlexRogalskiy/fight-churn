This is code for the book "***Fighting Churn With Data: Science and strategy for keeping your customers***"; the book serves as a detailed guide to the code.  You can get more information at:

- https://www.manning.com/books/fighting-churn-with-data, the publisher (Manning Publications)'s page for the book
- http://www.fightchurnwithdata.com, the author's blog site
- https://www.twitch.tv/carl24k_datascience, the author's live stream
- [The author's You Tube Channel, Fighting Churn With Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGVh5vcL4AAxErNdqJrr_Sw/featured)

This page contains the most up to date setup instructions, as well as information about some extra code that is mentioned in the book.

## Note from the Author

Before you can load data or run the code you have to do some setup on your system. If you never have done this before it may seem like a lot of work, and it kind of is, but this amount of setup is routine
when you begin to work with a new technology. These are basic startup/setup instructions that I think should work for most people using either shell Python, Jupyter Notebook, or an IDE, on either Mac or Windows.  I also want to apologize in advance because I am neither an expert in PostgreSQL nor an expert in Python, but I am about to give a lot of advice on how to setup and use these technologies - if you find I am not doing things the best way, or just not how you would have done it, please be patient.  Same goes for the rudimentary state of some of the code - I'm doing the best I can with the time I've got.  If you want to make things better please help help out! :)

## **Setup Instructions**  

*WARNING TO PYPI USERS: None of the internal links in this document work on the pypi.org website!

### Pre-Requisite Setup

Python and PostgreSQL are required.

1. [Pre-Requistes Start Here!](./readme_files/prereq.md)

### Code Setup

After the pre-requesisites, you have a choice on how to run the Fighting Churn With Data Code:

- [Command Line Setup](./readme_files/cmdline.md) : The fastest and easiest way to get started, using a pip Python package installation. This is great if you want to run the code and see the output, but you do not want to change it or run it line by line.
- [Jupyter Notebook Setup](readme_files/notebook.md) : This is an alternative quick start, if you already have Jupyter Notebooks installed.
- [Developers IDE Setup](readme_files/ide.md) : This method takes more time, but allows you to run 
  the code line by line in a debugger, or change it. (If you are a professional developer 
  planning to really use the code for your company, this is for you.)

## Extras

There are also some extra code parts, which are partially documented on this page..
